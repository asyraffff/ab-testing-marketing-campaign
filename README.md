# A/B Testing for website marketing strategy

**A/B Testing** means analyzing two marketing strategies to choose the best marketing strategy that can convert more traffic into sales (or more traffic into your desired goal) effectively and efficiently.

### Conclusions from the analysis

- From the A/B tests, I found that the control campaign resulted in **more sales and engagement from the visitors**. 
- More products were viewed from the control campaign, resulting in more products in the cart and more sales. 
- But the conversation rate of products in the cart is higher in the test campaign. 
- The test campaign resulted in more sales according to the products viewed and added to the cart. 
- And the control campaign results in more sales overall. 
- So, the Test campaign can be used to market a specific product to a specific audience, and the Control campaign can be used to market multiple products to a wider audience.
